Graduated in computer technical.</br>
Currently studying multiplatform application development.

## 👨‍💻 About me...
I have always liked the world of computing, so much so that I began to study 100% everything related to this world.
It all started with I simply searched the Internet until I learned to navigate the computer environment from hardware to programming to electronics.
During all this time I have learned to use some programming languages, programs and 3D design and printing. Every day I want to start creating and learning something new.
